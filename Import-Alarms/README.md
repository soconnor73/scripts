This script uses the KSCTL command line utility to import recommended event alarm configurations into the **Thales CipherTrust Data Security Platform**. 

Event alarms should be restricted to events you need the CipherTrust administrators to be aware of - configuration changes or unsafe behavior. Standard event correlation, dashboards and reporting are typically done by forwarding CipherTrust log records to your SIEM or log analyitics solution.
